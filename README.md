# sam-fusee-launcher
Fusee Launcher for the SparkFun SAMD21 breakout boards. Based on [Fusee Launcher](https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher).

Built and tested with PlatformIO but the Arduino IDE probably works also.

## Supported boards:
- [SparkFun SAMD21 Dev Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13672)
- [SparkFun SAMD21 Mini Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13664)

Note that the Switch does NOT provide power in RCM, so you will need to power the boards from a battery or something else!
